## _DELETE_WEAPON_OBJECTS_ON_HORSE

```cpp
// 0xD4C6E24D955FF061
void _DELETE_WEAPON_OBJECTS_ON_HORSE(Any horse);
```

Deletes all visible weapon PROP objects attached to a horse's holsters/rack.
This removes only the *rendered/attached objects*; it does not remove the weapons from inventory and they remain usable.

Parameters:
- horse: Horse ped whose attached weapon objects should be removed.

Notes:
- Useful to clear the horse's visible long-gun/holster props after manually attaching via 0x14FF0C2545527F9B.
- Always validate the ped handle before calling.
