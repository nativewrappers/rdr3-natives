## _GET_CAN_SWITCH_WEAPON

```cpp
// 0xBC9444F2FF94A9C0
Any _GET_CAN_SWITCH_WEAPON(Any ped);
```

Returns whether the ped is currently allowed to switch weapons (weapon switching not locked by internal code/state).

Script evidence: used as an additional gate in NPLOI__CAN_GUN_SPIN_PREVIEW; when it returns false scripts log "Prevented by Code" even if twirl-capable weapons exist in hand/holsters.
