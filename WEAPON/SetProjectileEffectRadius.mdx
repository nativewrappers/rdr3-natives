## _SET_PROJECTILE_EFFECT_RADIUS

```cpp
// 0x74C9080FDD1BB48F
void _SET_PROJECTILE_EFFECT_RADIUS(Any projectile, Any radius);
```

Sets the explosion/impact effect radius for an existing projectile entity (e.g., thrown dynamite).

Notes:
- Set before detonation/impact; no effect after.
- Does not ignite/detonate; it only changes the projectile's later effect.
- Typical R* flow: find projectile handle (e.g. GET_PROJECTILE_OF_PROJECTILE_TYPE_WITHIN_DISTANCE or _GET_PROJECTILE_IGNITED_IN_VOLUME) then apply a radius (e.g. 2.0f).
- R* also sets very small values (e.g. 0.01f) when an ignited projectile is detected in a volume, likely to minimize the resulting blast/effect while keeping the same projectile.
