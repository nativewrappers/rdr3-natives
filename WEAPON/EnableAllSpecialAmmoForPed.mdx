void _ENABLE_ALL_SPECIAL_AMMO_FOR_PED(Any ped, Any weaponHash);
```

Re-enables all special ammo variants for the given weapon on the specified ped (inverse of _DISABLE_ALL_SPECIAL_AMMO_FOR_PED).

Notes:
	- Restores access to any supported special ammo types for that weapon (e.g. express, high velocity, split point, explosive, etc.).
	- Useful to toggle back from a "regular ammo only" restriction.
	- Per-ped/per-weapon setting.
