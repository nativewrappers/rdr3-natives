## _CAN_PED_HEAR_TARGET_PED

```cpp
// 0x0EA9EACBA3B01601
BOOL _CAN_PED_HEAR_TARGET_PED(Ped source, Ped listener, BOOL includeNoiseBoost);
```

Returns true if `listener` can hear `source`.
If `includeNoiseBoost` is true, the source's noise radius is applied (easier to hear).
It treats the source as louder—its current noise expands the effective hearing range (by subtracting noiseRadius² from dist²), while false uses the baseline distance-only check (stealth).

## Parameters
* **source**:
* **listener**:
* **includeNoiseBoost**: Usually includeNoiseBoost is set to false when listener is in stealth mode

## Return value
Return `true` if the listener is heard by the source listener.
