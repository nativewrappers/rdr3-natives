## SET_PED_AS_COP

```cpp
// 0xBB03C38DD3FB7FFD
void SET_PED_AS_COP(Ped ped, BOOL toggle);
```

Turns the desired ped into a cop. If you use this on the player ped, you will become almost invisible to cops dispatched for you. You will also report your own crimes, get a generic cop voice, get a cop-vision-cone on the radar, and you will be unable to shoot at other cops. Toggling ped as "false" has no effect; you must change p0's ped model to disable the effect.
toggle = bSetRelGroup

## Parameters
* **ped**:
* **toggle**:
