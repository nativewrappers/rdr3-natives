## _SET_PED_WETNESS

```c
// 0xF9CFF5BB70E8A2CB
void _SET_PED_WETNESS(Ped ped, float amount);
```

This only works if you call [native: SET_PED_WETNESS_HEIGHT] first, or if you set `amount` to `0.0` or it dries natually you will have to apply `SET_PED_WETNESS_HEIGHT` again

## Parameters
* **ped**:
* **amount**: How wet the ped should appear ranges from `0.0`-`1.0`
