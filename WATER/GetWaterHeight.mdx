## GET_WATER_HEIGHT

```c
// 0xFCA8B23F28813F69
BOOL GET_WATER_HEIGHT(Vector3 pos, float* height);
```

Checks against a global variable that is set by _SET_WORLD_WATER_TYPE. If that is set to one it will fail. Likely not the only issue but part of it.

## Parameters
* **pos**:
* **height**:

## Return value
