## _GET_TASK_COMBAT_READY_TO_SHOOT

```cpp
// 0x5EA655F01D93667A
bool _GET_TASK_COMBAT_READY_TO_SHOOT(Ped ped);
```

Returns true if the ped is in a ranged-attack task and is about to fire (ready/primed to shoot or throw).
Covers firearms and projectiles (throwables/molotov/poison), not melee.
Useful to block other actions just before the shot. Note: different from IS_PED_SHOOTING, which triggers only after the shot.
May return true even in cases where IS_PED_WEAPON_READY_TO_SHOOT returns false.


## Parameters
* **ped**:

## Return value
Returns `true` if the specified `ped` is currently in combat using a ranged weapon, and is ready to shoot (actively attempting to attack)
