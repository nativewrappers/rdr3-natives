## SET_CHEAT_ACTIVE

```c
// 0xD4958E8CF0DE0DD0
void SET_CHEAT_ACTIVE(int cheatId);
```

Cheats are GTA IV cheats:

0 = unknown
1 = unknown (same as 0)
2 = Max Health and Armor
3 = Raise Wanted Level
4 = Lower Wanted Level
5 = unknown (does nothing)
6 = Change Weather
7 = Spawn Annihilator
8 = Spawn NRG 900
9 = Spawn FBI
10 = Spawn Jetmax
11 = Spawn Comet
12 = Spawn Turismo
13 = Spawn Cognoscenti
14 = Spawn Super GT
15 = Spawn Sanchez

Initially used in Max Payne 3, that's why we know the name.
