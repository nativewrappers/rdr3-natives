## GET_ENTITY_COORDS

```cpp
// 0xA86D5F069399F44D
Vector3 GET_ENTITY_COORDS(Entity entity, BOOL alive = false, BOOL realCoords = false);
```

Gets the current coordinates for a specified entity.
`entity` = The entity to get the coordinates from.
`alive` = Unused by the game, potentially used by debug builds in order to assert whether or not an entity was alive.

If entity is a ped and it's in a vehicle or on a mount the coords of that entity are returned. Set 'realCoords' to true when you need the true ped coords.


## Parameters
* **entity**: The entity to get the coords of
* **alive**: Unused, likely a leftover debug flag.
* **realCoords**: When the `entity` is a ped, setting this to `true` will return the ped's actual position instead of the mounts, when set to `false` it will return the mounts position.

## Return value
The `entity`'s position, or `vector3(0, 0, 0)` if the `entity` was invalid.
