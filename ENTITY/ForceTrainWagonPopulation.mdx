## _FORCE_TRAIN_WAGON_POPULATION

```cpp
// 0x119A5714578F4E05
void _FORCE_TRAIN_WAGON_POPULATION(Any trainWagon, Any toggle);
```

Enable/disable automatic ambient passenger population on a train wagon (carriage).
	- toggle=true: wagon is kept populated; removed/deleted passengers are replaced quickly.
	- toggle=false: stop auto-filling; after removing passengers, no new peds spawn until re-enabled.

Notes:
	- Intended for train carriage entities (wagons) obtained from a train (e.g., VEHICLE::GET_TRAIN_CARRIAGE).
	- Often used with passenger collection via VEHICLE::_GET_ALL_WAGON_PASSENGERS.

Example (from scripts):
	for (int i = 0; i < VEHICLE::_GET_NUM_CARS_FROM_TRAIN_CONFIG(trainConfig); ++i) {
		Vehicle wagon = VEHICLE::GET_TRAIN_CARRIAGE(train, i);
		if (ENTITY::DOES_ENTITY_EXIST(wagon) && !ENTITY::IS_ENTITY_DEAD(wagon)) {
			ENTITY::_FORCE_TRAIN_WAGON_POPULATION(wagon, true);
		}
	}


## Parameters
* **trainWagon**:
* **toggle**:
