## SET_ENTITY_HEALTH

```cpp
// 0xAC2767ED8BDFAB15
void SET_ENTITY_HEALTH(Entity entity, u16 healthAmount, Entity entityKilledBy = nullptr);
```

[note: Peds cannot have their health set higher than their core attribute allow.]
[note: If `entityKilledBy` is a vehicle, internally it will automatically attribute the kill to the driver]

Sets the entity's health to the specified `healthAmount`, setting this to `0` will kill the entity (if it's killable).

## Parameters
* **entity**: The entity to set the health of
* **healthAmount**: The amount of health the entity should have
* **entityKilledBy**: The entity that killed `entity` or `nullptr` for none
